--core displaying a random word to a user to attempt to guess correctly in some sort of timeframe(timer)
how am I going to randomly choose a word for the user to guess??
how do i turn the random word into blanks???
how do i know based on the character they typed if it is part of that word?  need an event handler thats listening for a keyboard event
once I have captured that value, how can i then check if that key they pressed is a part of that word???
if it is, display the character in any blank that is part of the word
